# Classifying Iris Data Set
Using Google Co-lab (free) to classify the Iris data set using Dimension Reduction using PCA. New to AI and ML.

The Task (Supervised Learning Task: As I know my Targets):
I wanted to classify if a flower belonged to "Iris-setosa", "Iris-versicolor", "Iris-verginica" based on features. Using PCA I reduced the dimensionality to 2D and then used kNN looking at the 10 nearest neigbours which classified judged the value on which group it belongs too.
